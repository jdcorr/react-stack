## Isomorphic Fullstack Boilerplate

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) //
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) //
[React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) //
[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) //
[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) //
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) //
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) //
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

Much of this boilerplate was the result of stepping through https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch while making stylistic changes to the architecture/technologies included (notably flat component file structure and omission of Bootstrap). Also added React Storybook for component stubbing and style guide.


### Build Steps
1. `yarn install`
2. Start dev server `yarn dev:wds`
3. Start app `yarn start`
4. Run in production mode `yarn prod:start`
